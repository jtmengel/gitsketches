===========
== ABOUT ==
===========

This is the repository acting as a place for me to post little scripts that I create for various tasks.

This is not meant to reflect large projects, but is meant more to be an analog to a sketchbook; when I
have ideas, I'll try to flesh them out here. Experiments (failed or successful), curiosities, & studies
all have a place here. Everything here is made to be shared (though I don't promise anything will be 
necessarily worth sharing...!) and cultivate more sharing.

I hope you enjoy reading through this repo,
JT


===========
== FILES ==
===========

Currently I'm going to structure the repo's files such that the levels are:

./[Language]/[files]

If this changes at any point in time and subdirectories are added, I'll update this README.
